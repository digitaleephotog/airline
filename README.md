Test Airline database using node.js


This file is part of a test as I learn how to use node.js.  This is based on a lynda.com assignment, and is intended to complete an assignment for my FTClass in Web Dev.  

Really nothing to see here, unless you are my instructor or one of my mentors (JH I'm talking to you!)
